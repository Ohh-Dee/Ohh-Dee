## Hi there 👋

I'm Oscar, a software developer based in the U.S.

I set a goal to design and build it!

If there is anything I lack or experience any hurdles, I am quick to add new skills to my toolset in order to meet
the goal.

My main tech stack is Python, C#, C++, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
I always work on projects in my free time in order to keep my skills sharp, with some of my favorites pinned. 

Fun Facts:
- 10-year veteran (USMC)
- Daily Linux
- Hobbies: Gym, Automotive Projects, Cooking
